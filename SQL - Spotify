# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle, created the following table and inserted the data from the .csv file. Then I analyzed the data to learn more about the most popular artists and tracks.

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#1. Top 5 most popular artists with their average duration, danceability, and energy.
SELECT
    artist_name,
    avg(popularity),
    avg(duration_ms),
    avg(danceability),
    avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY avg(popularity) DESC
LIMIT 5


#2. Top 10 most popular tracks with their average duration, danceability, and energy.
SELECT
    artist_name,
    track_name,
    popularity,
    duration_ms,
    danceability,
    energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10


#3. Creating a temporary table to view the most popular artists.
WITH AvgPopularity AS (
SELECT
    spot.artist_name,
    AVG(spot.popularity) AS Avg_Popularity
FROM Spotifydata AS spot
GROUP BY spot.artist_name
)

SELECT
    artist_name,
    Avg_Popularity,
    'Top Star' AS tag
FROM AvgPopularity
WHERE Avg_Popularity >= 90;
